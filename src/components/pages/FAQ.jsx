      question: "How does DetoxIT work?",
      answer: "DetoxIT connects people who want to donate their unused electronic devices with individuals and organizations that need them. Donors list their devices on our platform, and recipients can browse and request them. Once a match is made, we facilitate the handover process."
    },
    {
      question: "What types of devices can I donate?",
      answer: "We accept working laptops, desktop computers, tablets, smartphones, and peripherals like monitors, keyboards, and mice. The devices should be in functional condition, though minor cosmetic damage is acceptable."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I prepare my device for donation?",
      answer: "Before donating, please back up your important data, then perform a factory reset to remove all personal information. For computers, we recommend reinstalling the operating system. We have detailed guides available for different devices in our resources section."
    },
    {
      question: "Is my donation tax-deductible?",
      answer: "Yes, if you're donating to our registered non-profit partners. After your donation is complete, you'll receive a receipt that can be used for tax purposes. Please consult with a tax professional regarding how this applies to your specific situation."
    },
    {
      question: "Who can request a device?",
      answer: "Devices are available to individuals with demonstrated need, educational institutions, non-profit organizations, and community centers. During the request process, we'll ask for information to verify eligibility."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does the donation process take?",
      answer: "Once you've listed a device, it typically takes anywhere from a few days to a few weeks to find a match, depending on demand. The actual handover process usually takes 1-2 weeks to arrange logistics."
    },
    {
      question: "How is the device handover arranged?",
      answer: "After a match is made, we provide both parties with detailed instructions. Options include direct meetups for local donations, shipping with prepaid labels for longer distances, or drop-off at one of our partner locations."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens to devices that cannot be reused?",
      answer: "Devices that are not suitable for reuse are sent to our certified e-waste recycling partners, who ensure that components are properly recycled and harmful materials are disposed of safely."
    },
    {
      question: "Is my personal information secure?",
      answer: "Yes, we take data security very seriously. We never share your contact information without consent, and we have strict protocols for data handling. Please see our Privacy Policy for more details."
    },
    {
      question: "How can I get involved beyond donating a device?",
      answer: "There are many ways to support our mission! You can volunteer as a technical refurbisher, become a donor liaison, contribute financially, or help spread the word about our platform. Visit our Contact page to learn more about volunteering opportunities."
